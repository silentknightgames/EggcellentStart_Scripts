# Eggcellent-Start
 
Bored at home during the pandemic? Not knowing what to do this weekend? Let's make some egg tarts today and have an "Eggcellent Start"! From buying ingredients, to packing your tarts into a nice gift box, you'll be experiencing the joy of making this delicious snack through fun minigames.

As my very first game made with Unity, the main purpose of this game is to help me get familiar with the game engine and coding. For instance, the memory game has helped me practice using lists in C# while the packing scene requires me to apply my fundamental knowledge of UI in Unity, like the drag and drop function.
